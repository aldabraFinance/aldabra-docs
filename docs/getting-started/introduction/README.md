# Introduction

Aldabra Finance is the decentralized ecosystem of stablecoins, that is autonomous and non-custodial by using blockchain technology that relies on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The protocol was designed to solve three major problems:
- **Unnecessary loss** by slippage and price impact when trading stablecoins. 
- **Lack of opportunities** to generate more yield from excessive liquidity.
- **Inflexibility** to support new stablecoins in the single liquidity pool.

Aldabra Finance offers a solution to these three problems through three protocols:

**Stable Pool** introduces the STAL stablecoin was designed to be a 100% USD-pegged stablecoin, which is fully backed by USD stablecoins that are `flexible to add or remove in the single liquidity pool.`

**Constant Swap** allows users to efficiently swap stablecoins through the Aldabra Swap protocol, what is an automated market maker (AMM) that `supports zero slippage and price impact.`

**Yield Earning** offers the traditional yield farm to earn ALDABRA tokens from fair launch distributing and the Vault `to earn maximize interest` from autonomously depositing stablecoins to decentralized lending protocols.

## Launch Plan

Aldabra Finance is a fair launch project with no pre-sale, no investor, and no pre-mine. Everyone will be eligible to get ALDABRA tokens equally by joining the testing period and/or providing liquidity after Aldabra Finance is launched. [(More details)](../../our-protocols/yield-earning/#yield-farm)

**Why is there a testing period?**

Because Aldabra Finance introduces the protocol that develops a new algorithm for the Aldabra ecosystem. Therefore we need your help to test our protocols and build the community before launching.

It is possible to say that our `smart contracts are approved by the community.`

When the testing period ended, everyone who participated will get airdrop as ALDABRA token.

You can joint the testing period on BSC testnet and help us build the community by:
