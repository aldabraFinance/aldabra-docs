# Yield Earning

Aldabra Finance offers the Yield Earning feature to all users to earn rewards while supporting the Aldabra ecosystem.

### The Vault

the Vault was designed to generate a native interest rate. This is achieved through the Aldabra smart contracts programmatically depositing the underlying stablecoins into decentralized lending protocols to generate yield. In addition, trading, minting and redemption fees generated through **the Aldabra Stable pool and Swap protocol** will be passed on to users holding deposits in the Vault.

`As interest and fees accrue, new STAL is minted and sent to the Vault.`

When a user opts in to receive interest by depositing STAL tokens into the Vault they will receive interest-bearing tokens (ibSTAL). These interest-bearing tokens will not have the value of the underlying stablecoins but will appreciate in value over time. Users can be withdrawn at any time, resulting in the user receiving their original deposit plus accrued interest.

Moreover, users are also given the option to deposit their interest-bearing tokens (ibSTAL) into the **Yield Farm**. This is a place where users can earn ALDABRA tokens. Which is important to receive a share of platform revenues and participate in governance.

**Performance fee :** 20% of gains harvested from decentralized lending protocols will be sent to the Aldabra treasury.
