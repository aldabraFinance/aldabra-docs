# Lock & Vote

Lock & Vote is a modified form of governance staking. Governance voters lock their governance tokens to participate in voting. This prevents governance attacks and aligns incentives between voters and long-term holders.

Investors who are willing to deposit and lock their ALDABRA tokens for a period of up to one year will be rewarded with GOVER token. GOVER provides holders with several benefits. These benefits are:
- Voting power on governance decisions (1 GOVER = 1 Vote)
- Receive a share of platform revenues via an interest-bearing token (ibSTAL)
